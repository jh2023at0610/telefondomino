# 🎨 PWA Icons Needed

The app is fully functional without these icons! They're only needed for PWA installation.

## Missing Files:
- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

## How to Create Icons:

### Option 1: PWA Builder (Easiest)
1. Go to https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload your logo (any size)
3. Download generated icons
4. Place `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in `public/` folder

### Option 2: Manual Creation
Use any image editor:
- Create 192x192 pixel PNG
- Create 512x512 pixel PNG
- Use your game logo/branding
- Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`

### Option 3: Simple Placeholder
Use an emoji or solid color as a quick placeholder:
- Background color: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Add game controller emoji 🎮 or domino emoji
- Export as PNG

## For Now:
**You can ignore these errors!** The game is fully playable without icons. Icons are only needed when installing as a PWA on mobile devices.

## Test Your Game:
1. Keep the app running
2. Open another browser window
3. Test creating and joining rooms!
